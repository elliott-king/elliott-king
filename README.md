### Hello, I'm Elliott King

I am a full-stack developer based in the US. I especially like the intersection of data and full-stack, and many of my projects reflect that. Data Science tickles the empirical part of my brain, but making projects that grow, walk, and run is my true passion.

I am currently volunteering with the [Astoria Digital](https://astoria.digital/) NYC-based aid organization. They provide web development and technical support for local volunteer organizations.
